I have implemented human and vehicle detection and there depth estimation and results are good for on test set but the camera calibration is not there so it might not give good results in real life. my results are stored in results folder but due to having multiple college exams this week I was not able to implement the complete task on a video footoage my implementation works on images for now and deployment of the model on web app was not complete.
I am implement the same on videos as well and my concepts of computer vision are very strong and also know the complete ml pipeline and can deploy the models too.
Just due to exams the task done is not upto the mark.
